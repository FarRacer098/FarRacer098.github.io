          <p> Hi, I am Shivam. A Computer Science Student interested in lerning about New Technology. I started my Technical journey after completing 10th standard. I started with python language and did programming for 1 year using python. In which I make many tools related to information gathering for hacking (ethically) by automations. Tools I make using Python - Subdomain Enumeration, Port Scanner, Directory Enumeration and more. I write my own OSINT tool Script. But I take help of AI for making these tools to learn new things and technology. Currently I am in 2nd year of CSE, interested in learning - C Language, DBMS.</p>
